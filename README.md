# Python_Projects

This repository contains my collection of Python-based projects, scripts, and experiments.  
Most of the code here reflects my ongoing learning journey and may include mini-projects, prototypes, or in-progress applications.

## üîß Purpose

This repo serves as a **central place for smaller or ongoing Python projects**, especially those that:
- Are still under development.
- Are built for learning and experimentation.
- Don't yet require a dedicated repository.

Once a project becomes fully developed or more complex (e.g., Django apps, desktop apps, or web tools), I move it to its own separate repository for better clarity and organization.

## üìÅ Projects Included

Here are some of the scripts and mini-projects currently in this repo:
- Password strength tester prototype
- To-Do List App

## üìå Note

For more complete or production-ready applications, please visit my other repositories (coming soon).
